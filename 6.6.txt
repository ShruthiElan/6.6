
1. Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler

Answer:

FIFO Scheduler:
• The FIFO Scheduler places applications in a queue and runs them in the order of submission (first in, first out).
• Requests for the first application in the queue are allocated first; once its requests have been satisfied, the next application in the queue is served, and so on.
• The FIFO Scheduler has the merit of being simple to understand and not needing any configuration, but it’s not suitable for shared clusters.
• Large applications will use all the resources in a cluster, so each application has to wait its turn. On a shared cluster, it is better to use the Capacity Scheduler or the Fair Scheduler. 

Capacity Scheduler:
• With the Capacity Scheduler, a separate dedicated queue allows the small job to start as soon as it is submitted.
• This is at the cost of overall cluster utilization since the queue capacity is reserved for jobs in that queue.
• If queues are not designed or used properly, some queues may be overloaded while some may be underutilised.
• Large job finishes late when compared with using the FIFO Scheduler.
2. What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x

Answer:

Limitations of Hadoop 1.x
1. JobTracker keeps track of resource utilization and job monitoring.
2. Suited for maximum of 4000 nodes and 40000 tasks.
3. TaskTracker is configured with static slots. Moreover, a map tasks can not run on reduce slot. So cluster utilization is low.
4. Supports only MapReduce processing model.

Advantages of Hadoop 2.x
1. Resource Utilization is taken care by ResourceManager and NodeManager, whereas job monitoring is taken care by ApplicationMaster.
2. It can scale up to 10000 nodes and 100000 tasks.
3. Resources are dynamic and finegrained. This leads to better cluster utilization.
4. Supports processing models other than Map Reduce.
